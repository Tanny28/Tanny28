A AI student obsessed with **Artificial Intelligence** and what it can unlock. I don't wait for the perfect moment to build — I pick up any idea that excites me, learn what I need, and ship it.

I'm not here to clone tutorials. If it's been built a thousand times, I'm not interested. I care about building things that are genuinely useful — real problems, real solutions, powered by AI.

Currently deep into the intersection of **LLMs, AI agents, and real-world applications**. Every project I build is a step toward understanding how intelligent systems can change the way we work, create, and solve problems.

If you're looking for someone who is **hungry to learn, fast to ship, and serious about AI** — let's talk. 🤝

Currently working on:

- [Project One](https://your-project-one-url.com) — Short punchy description of what it is
- [Project Two](https://your-project-two-url.com) - Your second active project. Any platform. The cool way. 🚀
